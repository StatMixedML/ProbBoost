# ProbBoost
A unified framework for Probabilistic Boosting.

# Introduction
We propose a new boosting framework that predicts the entire conditional distribution of a univariate response variable. In particular, ProbBoost combines existing probabilistic boosting implementations, i.e., [XGBoostLSS](https://github.com/StatMixedML/XGBoostLSS), [CatBoostLSS](https://github.com/StatMixedML/CatBoostLSS), [LightGBMLSS](https://github.com/StatMixedML/LightGBMLSS) into unified framework.
